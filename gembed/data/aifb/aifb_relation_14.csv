However, industrial and academic environments are very dynamic, thus inducing changes to application requirements. To fulfill these changes, often the underlying ontology must be evolved as well. As ontologies grow in size, the complexity of change management increases, thus requiring a well-structured ontology evolution process. In this paper we identify a possible six-phase evolution process and focus on providing the user with capabilities to control and customize it. We introduce the concept of an evolution strategy encapsulating policy for evolution with respect to userâ€™s requirements."

Since in general, there can be more than one possibilities (combinations of web services) to achieve a certain goal, a user has to decide which of the alternatives suits him the best. This leads to the requirement that the combinations of web services must be comparable. This can be achieved by aggregating web service attributes. Since the ranking of web service combinations depends on user's needs, capabilities and willingness for ivestment of resources, considering user preferences is important while calculating the rank of a web service composition. We show, how user preferences as well as aggregation information can be modeled in a formal way and how web service combinations can be ranked automatically based on this information."

It integrates semiformal specification techniques, formal specification techniques, and prototyping into a coherent framework. This allows the domain and task model of a kbs to be described on different formalization levels. All activities in the building process are embedded in a cyclic life cycle model. For the semiformal representation we use a hypermedia-based formalism which serves as a communication basis between expert and knowledge engineer during knowledge acquisition. The semiformal knowledge representation is also the basis for formalization, resulting in a formal and executable model of expertise specified in the Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Language (KARL). Since KARL is executable the model of expertise can be developed and validated by prototyping. A smooth transition from a semiformal to a formal specification and further on to design is achieved as all the description techniques rely on the same conceptual model to describe the functional and non-functional aspects of the system. Thus, the system is thoroughly documented at different description levels, each of which focuses on a distinct aspect of the entire development effort. Traceability of requirements is supported by linking the different models to each other. Though the MIKE approach aims at supporting the building process of kbs, its principles and methods apply also to the development of non-knowledge-based software systems, e.g. information systems."

The learning target is to find a set of goal clauses which can be used to define a target predicate. That is, we deal with single-predicate learning. For the search process we use the learning algorithm JoJo/Frog which provides a flexible search strategy. The transition from the first-order representation to the representation in propositional logic is achieved by ground substitutions which transform clauses into ground clauses. Taking a closer look at this transition makes clear that the sufficiency condition which is used by algorithms like FOIL and LINUS as a criterion for judging the achieved learning results does not correspond to the completeness condition in the propositional case. Therefore, we use an extended completeness condition which captures all information given by the example knowledge. As a consequence we get a new definition of positive and negative examples. Instead of ground facts we regard ground substitutions as examples."

It provides language primitives to represent knowledge according to the layers of a KADS-oriented model of expertise. The main features of KARL are: It provides epistemologically adequate modelling primitives allowing knowledge specifications at the so-called knowledge level. It is a formal knowledge specification language. That is, it has a declarative semantics. It is an operational knowledge specification language which allows prototyping. Chapter one introduces the basic idea of KARL. The main object of KARL is to fill or to narrow the gap between the implementation and the conceptual description of a knowledge-based system by defining a formal and operational specification language. It is related to the symbol level because it is a language with a formal and operational semantics. It is related to the knowledge level because it abstracts from all implementational details which are concerned with the realization by an efficient implementation. Chapter two, three, and four introduce the language KARL itself. KARL consists of the two languages L-KARL and P-KARL. Chapter two introduces the language L-KARL which is used to model static knowledge. P-KARL which is used to model procedural knowledge (i.e., knowledge about the control flow of a problem-solving method) is described in chapter three. Finally, chapter four shows how these languages and their interaction are used to model the domain layer, the inference layer, and the task layer of a model of expertise. Then, the mathematical semantics of KARL is defined in chapter five. A model-theoretic semantics is defined which allows a precise and unique specification of knowledge-based systems. Besides KARL, some other languages have been developed during the last few years which aim to formalize or operationalize KADS models of expertise. Besides all technical details, the main difference between KARL and the other languages is the fact that KARL aims to be a formal and operational knowledge specification language. The object here is not only operationalization in principle, i.e., the possibility of using a kind of theorem-proving, but also an efficient evaluation to allow prototyping. In the conclusion, we compare KARL with one these languages which where developed as part of the KADS project. We also characterize some shortcomings of KARL and outline aspects of future work with it."

Due to the complexity of the alignment task, manually defined methods for (semi-)automatic alignment rarely constitute an optimal configuration of substrategies from which they have been built. In fact, scrutinizing current ontology alignment methods, one may recognize that most are not optimized for given ontologies. Some few include machine learning for automating the task, but their optimization by machine learning means is mostly restricted to the extensional definition of ontology concepts. With APFEL (Alignment Process Feature Estimation and Learning) we present a machine learning approach that explores the user validation of initial alignments for optimizing alignment methods. The methods are based on extensional and intensional ontology definitions. Core to APFEL is the idea of a generic alignment process, the steps of which may be represented explicitly. APFEL then generates new hypotheses for what might be useful features and similarity assessments and weights them by machine learning approaches.

representing knowledge in the Semantic Web. Knowledge Elicitation (KE)
is usually one of the first steps in building ontologies. A number
of ontology editors such as Protege have been developed to
assist users in building ontologies efficiently. However,
traditional KE techniques, such as card sorting
and laddering, are not yet supported, but performed manually and
outside of such tools.  In this paper we present a methodology and
a corresponding plug-in for Protege that allows
graphical ellicitation knowledge from documents using card sorting
and laddering approaches. Our aim is to seamlessly integrate the
KE techniques into the ontology building
process to make ontology building more efficient and less
error-prone. As a side-effect the persistent storage of card
sorting and laddering results allows for later traceability of ontology development.
KE largely depends on user interaction with the
plug-in, therefore we employed user-centred design principles to
capture requirements. After implementation, the plug-in was
evaluated thoroughly against the requirements. The evaluation
shows that this KE plug-in meets many of the
user's expectations and indeed saves them considerable time when
building ontologies."

to the high costs for applying OntoClean, especially on tagging concepts
with the correct meta-properties. In order to facilitate the use of OntoClean and to enable proper evaluation of it in real-world cases, we provide
AEON, a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate OntoClean
meta-properties. The implementation can be easily expanded to
check the concepts for other abstract meta-properties, thus providing for
the first time tool support in order to enable intensional ontology evaluation
for concepts. Our main idea is using the web as an embodiment of
objective world knowledge, where we search for patterns indicating concepts
meta-properties. We get an automatic tagging of the ontology, thus
reducing costs tremendously. Moreover, AEON lowers the risk of having
subjective taggings. As part of the evaluation we report our experiences
from creating a middle-sized OntoClean-tagged reference ontology."

The FPGA controller can decide on-line where to place new tasks onto the FPGA. Rearranging a subset of the tasks executing on the FPGA may allow the next pending task to be processed sooner. When tasks are rearranged, the arriving input data have to be buffered while the execution is suspended. In this paper, we describe and evaluate an evolutionary approach to solve the problem of placing and rearranging tasks that are supplied by input streams which have constant data rates. We use two genetic algorithms (GAs): one for iodentifying feasible rearrangements and the other for scheduling a selected rearrangement so that the delay caused by this rearrangement is small and the limited input buffer size is respected."

There remain signi.cant hurdles to exploiting the extent of the Web's resources in a consistent, scalable and maintainable fashion. The autonomy and volatility of Web sources complicates maintaining wrappers consistent with the requirements of the data's target application. Also, the sources' semantic heterogeneity requires practical methods to mediate their contents. This paper describes our e.orts in developing an algebra on semistructured data. This algebra is the tool we use to develop and maintain wrappers, and mediate their semantic content. We describe wrapper creation, re.nement and maintenance as the process of developing a congruity measure between source data sets and their target application. The congruity measure expresses explicitly the context within which the source data is relevant for its target use. Enabling mediation between wrappers corresponds to establishing an articulation between data sources through a similarity measure. The similarity measure encapsulates conditions under which distinct sources may be used together. Examples using the algebra show how the Summarize operator enables creation and maintenance of a target data set from a source. We de.ne the Match operator and demonstrate its use in mediating the content of similar sources. We have applied these two operators respectively to an online dictionary with over 125,000 di.erent terms, and to the web pages of NATO gov- ernments and their allies. We give a description of the rule language that we use to wrap and mediate sources, and conclude with the applications that motivate the other operations in the algebra."

Such an ontology can be used by a subgroup of web users that share a common point of interest like it is known from newsgroups in the internet. Therefore, we propose ontologies to be used to annotate intranets or certain subnets within the entire WWW.

It is an XML application that allows for the denotation of facts and schemata in a web-compatible format, building on an elaborate object-model for describing concepts and relations. Thus, it might turn up as a natural choice for a widely-useable ontology description language. However, its lack of capabilities for describing the semantics of concepts and relations beyond those provided by inheritance mechanisms makes it a rather weak language for even the most austere knowledge-based system. This paper presents an approach for modeling ontologies in RDF(S) that also considers axioms as objects that are describable in RDF(S). Thus, we provide flexible, extensible, and adequate means for accessing and exchanging axioms in RDF(S). Our approach follows the spirit of the World Wide Web, as we do not assume a global axiom specification language that is too intractable for one purpose and too weak for the next, but rather a methodology that allows (communities of) users to specify what axioms are interesting in their domain."

The learning target is to find a set of goal clauses that describe the true ground facts of a given target predicate. In our example setting we further assume that the background knowledge is also given in the form of true (and false) ground facts of each background predicate. By fixing the number of variables allowed in the derived clauses we show that no explicit negative goal facts are needed in the case of the closed-world assumption since the rules are evaluated from the premise to the head rather than binding the variables of the goal literal first. As a consequence we get an efficient ILP algorithm that tries to minimize the tuples of variable substitutions stored at each step of our covering approach.

Second, user interaction is a core aspect of Text2Onto and the fact that the system calculates a confidence for each learned object allows to design sophisticated visualizations of the POM. Third, by incorporating strategies for data-driven change discovery, we avoid processing the whole corpus from scratch each time it changes, only selectively updating the POM according to the corpus changes instead.

Rather, it is necessary to allow knowledge processing in a computer assisted way, for example to intelligently query the knowledge base. To this end, we propose the introduction of &lt;i&gt;typed links&lt;/i&gt; as an extremely simple and unintrusive way for rendering large parts of Wikipedia machine readable. We provide a detailed plan on how to achieve this goal in a way that hardly impacts usability and performance, propose an implementation plan, and discuss possible difficulties on Wikipedia's way to the semantic future of the World Wide Web. The possible gains of this endeavor are huge; we sketch them by considering some immediate applications that semantic technologies can provide to enhance browsing, searching, and editing Wikipedia."

The next generation of the Web, dubbed the &#8216;Semantic Web&#8217;, will extend the Web&#8217;s capability through the increased availability machine-processable information. These machine-processable descriptions of Web information resources are called meta-data and are associated with ontologies, or conceptualisations of the domain of application. Meta-data and associated ontologies then allows more intelligent software systems to be written, automating the analysis and exploitation of Web-based information.
This paper describes how knowledge management can be improved through the adoption of Semantic Web technology. To realise this, a number of different technologies need to be brought together. Their fusion provides the infrastructure which makes semantic knowledge management possible. Specifically, the paper discusses the use of knowledge discovery and human language technology to (semi-)automatically derive the required ontologies and meta-data, along with a methodology to support this process. We describe techniques for management and controlled evolution of ontologies and a set of semantic knowledge access tools for enhanced information access. Finally, a set of application scenarios for the technology are sketched."

We take a complementary point of view by focusing on these underlying assumptions as these assumptions play an important role: They are necessary to characterise the precise competence of a problem-solving method in terms of the tasks that can be solved by it and in terms of the domain knowledge that is required by it. They are necessary to enable tractable problem solving for complex problems. Their introduction and the refinement of existing assumptions can be used to develop new problem-solving methods or to adapt existing ones according to task and domain-specific circumstances of a given application. For this purpose, one require a framework for dealing with these assumptions. The paper makes a step in this direction by summarizing the assumptions that can be found in the literature on component-based diagnosis. The main contribution of the paper is to collect these assumptions, to make their role for the reasoning process explicit, and to systematize these assumptions by making explicit their relationships."

This general task necessarily involves considerations in various mathematical disciplines, some of which might be interesting in their own right and which can be read independently.<br><br>
 
To find suitable morphisms, we review the relationships of formal logic, algebra, topology, domain theory, and formal concept analysis (FCA). This leads to a rather complete exposition of the representation theory of algebraic lattices, including some novel interpretations in terms of FCA and an explicit proof of the cartestian closedness of the emerging category. It also introduces the main concepts of Â«domain theory in logical formÂ» for a particularly simple example.<br><br>
 
 In order to incorporate morphisms from FCA, we embark on the study of various context morphisms and their relationships. The discovered connections are summarized in a hierarchy of context morphisms, which includes dual bonds, scale measures, and infomorphisms.<br><br>
 
Finally, we employ the well-known means of Stone duality to unify the topological and the FCA-based approach. A notion of logical consequence relation with a suggestive proof theoretical reading is introduced as a morphism between deductive systems, and special instances of these relations are identified with morphisms from topology, FCA, and lattice theory. Especially, scale measures are recognized as topologically continuous mappings, and infomorphisms are identified both with coherent maps and with Lindenbaum algebra homomorphisms."

Thus, it might turn up as a natural choice for a widely-useable ontology description language.

Thus, we provide flexible, extensible, and adequate means for accessing and exchanging axioms in RDF(S).

The idea is to use a neural network to iterate a global counter n. For each clause Ci in the logic program, this counter is combined (fibred) with another neural network, which determines whether Ci outputs an atom of level n for a given interpretation I. As a result, the fibred network computes the singlestep operator TP of the logic program, thus capturing the semantics of the program."

Their key concern is to allow a community of users to present and share knowledge in a particular (set of) domain(s) via semantic methods. Thus, semantic portals aim at creating high-quality access - in contrast to methods like information retrieval or document clustering that do not exploit any semantic background knowledge at all. However, by way of this construction semantic portals may easily suffer from a typical knowledge management problem. Their initial value is low, because only little richly structured knowledge is available. Hence the motivation of its potential users to extend the knowledge pool is small, too. We here present SEAL-II, a methodology for semantic portals that extends its previous version, by providing a range of ontology-based means for hitting the soft spot between unstructured knowledge, which virtually comes for free, but which is of little use, and richly structured knowledge, which is expensive to gain, but of tremendous possible value.

This has changed dramatically: Knowledge Engineering is now a key technology in the upcoming knowledge society. Companies are recognizing knowledge as their key assets, which have to be exploited and protected in a fast changing, global and competitive economy. This situation has led to the application of Knowledge Engineering techniques in Knowledge Management. The demand for more efficient (business to) business processes requires the interconnection and interoperation of different information systems. But information access and integration is not an algorithmic task that is easy to solve: much knowledge is required to resolve the semantic differences of data residing in two information systems. Thus Knowledge Engineering has become a major technique for information integration. And, last but not least the fast growing World Wide Web generates an ever-increasing demand for more efficient knowledge exploitation and creation techniques. Here again Knowledge Engineering technologies may become the key technology for solving the problem. In this paper we discuss these recent developments and describe our view of the future."

A construction that tries to establish links between both paradigms is the
space of formal balls, a continuous poset which can be defined for every metric space and that reflects many of its properties. On the other hand, in order to obtain a broader framework for applications and possible connections to domain theory, generalized ultrametric spaces (gums) have been introduced. In this paper, we employ the space of formal balls as a tool for studying these more general metrics by using
concepts and results from domain theory. It turns out that many properties of the
metric can be characterized via its formal-ball space. Furthermore, we can state new results on the topology of gums as well as two new fixed point theorems, which may be compared to the PrieÃŸ-Crampe and Ribenboim theorem, and the Banach fixed point theorem, respectively. Deeper insights into the nature of formal-ball spaces are gained by applying methods from category theory. Our results suggest that, while
being a useful tool for the study of gums, the space of formal balls does not provide the hoped-for general connection to domain theory."

In this paper we present an approach that models this behaviour on the knowledge level, i.e. it takes into account not only which actions (questions) a shop assistant will perform, but also which goals he wants to achieve by taking an action. As a generic reasoning pattern of such an e-shop agent we use the cover-and-differentiate problem-solving method, a method very successfully applied in various diagnosis and classification tasks. In that way, we can (i) model the question-answering process such that the minimal set of useful questions will be provided to a user, (ii) easily reinterpret and fine-tune shopping strategies that exist in other e-shop portals and (iii) design and integrate new methods into generic reasoning pattern.

Our contribution to the 2003 Semantic Web Grand Challenge realizes semantic-based search and access facilities to information represented by semantic portals. Such portals typically provide knowledge about a specific domain and rely on ontologies to structure and exchange this knowledge. Computer science exploits ontologies to enhance knowledge sharing and reuse. First, ontologies provide a common, shared understanding of knowledge in an interest domain. Second, they capture and formalize knowledge by connecting human understanding of symbols with their machine processability. As such, ontologies play a key role for realizing the Semantic Web.
Our contribution extends and implements the basic conceptual framework SEAL (SEmantic portAL) with the aim of using semantic technologies in real-world scenarios through a reliable, scalable infrastructure. We also show how multiple semantic portals can interact with one another to exchange knowledge, thus fostering reuse. The building blocks of our extension include knowledge integration, processing, representation, organization, and access. Our approach has these benefits: (i) Significant reduction of content maintenance overhead, (ii) knowledge accessibility for both human and machine agents, atop existing information sources, and (iii) suitability for productive environments."

A separate layer that is language-specific, in fact it may even vary for different inference engines working on the same language, describes how these objects are translated into a goal representation. In addition to its far reaching independence with regard to specific representation languages, this approach benefits engineering since the semantics of important types of axioms may be much more elucidated in our ontology engineering tool, OntoEdit, than in comparable tools.

In the design phase, this representation is enriched by additional language primitives which focus on issues of realization and which facilitate the mapping of the model of expertise to the implementation environment. A smooth transition from semiformal to formal specification and further on to design is achieved as all the description techniques rely on the same conceptual model to describe the system.

The learning target is to find a set of goal clauses which can be used to define a target predicate. That is, we deal with single-predicate learning. For the search process we use the learning algorithm JoJo/Frog which provides a flexible search strategy. The transition from the first-order representation to the representation in propositional logic is achieved by ground substitutions which transform clauses into ground clauses. Taking a closer look at this transition makes clear that the sufficiency condition which is used by algorithms like FOIL and LINUS as a criterion for judging the achieved learning results does not correspond to the completeness condition in the propositional case. Therefore, we use an extended completeness condition which captures all information given by the example knowledge. As a consequence we get a new definition of positive and negative examples. Instead of ground facts we regard ground substitutions as examples."

In this paper, we show that reasoning in Horn-SHIQ, in spite of its low data-complexity, is ExpTime-hard with respect to the overall size of the knowledge base.

Third, both languages had to be combined to represent a complete model of expertise.

We preprocess our input data applying an ontology-based heuristics for feature selection and feature aggregation. Thus, we construct a number of alternative text representations.

In other words, only by searching for keywords, which are assigned to the content of an information resource, a machine agent cannot differ between various contexts of using these keywords, and some non-relevant resources will be retrieved as the result of the searching process.   
In this paper, we propose a method for improving the annotation of information resources â€“ by forming conditional statements about keywords used in the describing content of a resource. This kind of annotation leads to the better precision of the information retrieval process â€“ by expressing the context of searching in a more precise manner. Moreover, such more expressive form of describing content of information resources supports a more powerful knowledge sharing process enabling the discovery of new information by considering the combination of existing information resources. In that way, the system provides some answers which are not explicitly stated in the information repository.
We present a knowledge management framework which implements such type of annotation and give a small evaluation study. The framework is based on using Semantic Web tools, which are developed at our Institute."

Semantic Web is certainly doomed to failure. In earlier work we
presented a new paradigm to avoid this: the 'Self Annotating Web',
in which globally available knowledge is used to annotate
resources such as web pages. In particular, we presented a
concrete method instantiating this paradigm, called PANKOW
(Pattern-based ANnotation through Knowledge On the Web). In
PANKOW, a named entity to be annotated is put into several
linguistic patterns that convey competing semantic meanings. The
patterns that are matched most often on the Web indicate the
meaning of the named entity --- leading to automatic or
semi-automatic annotation.
In this paper we present C-PANKOW (Context-driven PANKOW), 
which alleviates several shortcomings of PANKOW. First, by downloading 
abstracts and processing them off-line, we avoid the generation of large
number of linguistic patterns and correspondingly large
number of Google queries.
Second, by linguistically analyzing and normalizing the downloaded
abstracts, we increase the coverage of our pattern matching
mechanism and overcome several limitations of the earlier pattern
generation process. Third, we use the annotation context in order
to distinguish the significance of a pattern match for the given
annotation task. Our experiments show that C-PANKOW

As a consequence of our conceptual model we can decompose the overall verification task of the knowledge-based systems into different proof obligations. Each proof obligation deals with a different aspect of the entire system. The use of the conceptual model in specification and verification improves understandability and reduces the effort for both activities. The modularization enables reuse of specifications and proofs.

In order to get a global picture of the behavior of a customer, his single transactions have to be composed together. In On-Line Analytical Processing, this operation is known as reverse pivoting. With the ongoing data analysis process, reverse pivoting has to be repeated several times, usually requir- ing an implementation in SQL. In this paper, we present a construction for conceptual scales for reverse pivoting in Conceptual Information Sys- tems, and also discuss the visualization. The construction allows the reuse of previously created queries without reprogramming and offers a visualization of the results by line diagrams."

Since not many real-world applications are reported using ILP-techniques this report describes some problems that may appear when starting such a project. The project was done in co-operation with HÃ¶gdalenverket, a heat and power plant burning household refuse in the Stockholm area, Sweden. The application problems with collecting data and the application of ILP-techniques are discussed. Results of tests performed while using SPECTRE, an ILP-algorithm developed at Stockholm University, are reported. These results show that the addition of background knowledge and addition/retraction of parameters has positive effect on the performance of the ILP-techniques. After initial tests a knowledge acquisition stage was started. This resulted in knowledge about the domain that was used for evaluating the results of learning using SPECTRE. This prevented several mistakes by interpreting data and evaluating performance. This knowledge was partly used as background knowledge for the learning algorithm. Noise handling was applied and increased the efficiency of the SPECTRE-algorithm. The paper lists the results of tests performed on data from the refuse-burning plant. It also compares the performance of the SPECTRE-algorithm on theoretical databases with the performance on this practical domain. It also gives some insight in the change of performance that can be expected when transferring from the laboratory-domains to domains gathered in the real-world."

In this talk we focus on the issue of determining a relevant resource in a completely decentralized setting such as necessitated by peer-to-peer knowledge management in virtual organizations. Requirements for this task include, e.g., full autonomy of peers as well as full control over own resources and therefore preclude prominent resource location and query routing schemes such as distributed hash tables. In order to tackle given requirements we use a resource location and query routing approach that exploits social metaphors of topical experts and experts&#8217; experts as well as semantic similarity of queries and information sources.

As query answering within such a general mapping system is undecidable, we identify a decidable fragment of the mapping system, which corresponds to OWL-DL extended with DL-safe rules.

The composition of content from different sources rarely produces satisfactory results.

The learning target is to find a set of goal clauses that describe the true ground facts of a given target predicate. In our example setting we further assume that the background knowledge is also given in the form of true (and false) ground facts of each background predicate. By fixing the number of variables allowed in the derived clauses we show that no explicit negative goal facts are needed in the case of the closed-world assumption since the rules are evaluated from the premise to the head rather than binding the variables of the goal literal first. As a consequence we get an efficient ILP algorithm that tries to minimize the tuples of variable substitutions stored at each step of our covering approach.

The PROTÃ‰GÃ‰-II framework includes a library of problem-solving methods that can be viewed as reusable components. For developers to use these components as building blocks in the construction of methods for new tasks, they must configure the components to fit with each other and with the needs of the new task. As part of this configuration process, developers must relate the ontologies of the generic methods to the ontologies associated with other methods and submethods. We present a model of method configuration that incorporates the use of several ontologies in multiple levels of methods and submethods, and we illustrate the approach by providing examples of the configuration of the board-game method."

The paper provides three novel contributions to knowledge engineering. First, we provide a structured approach for the development and adaptation of problem-solving method.

As a result, more and more appliances surrounding us are equipped with embedded computational power and wireless communication. As such, they become ever more flexible and multifunctional, and almost indispensable in daily life. On the other hand, the resulting systems become increasingly complex and unreliable, posing new challenges to designer and user.
Organic Computing (OC) has the vision to address the challenges of complex distributed systems by making them more life-like (organic), i.e. endowing them with abilities such as self-organization, self-configuration, self-repair, or adaptation. The designer's task is simplified, because it is no longer necessary to exactly specify the low-level system behavior in all possible situations that might occur, but instead leaving the system with a certain degree of freedom which allows it to react in an intelligent way to new situations. Also, use of such systems is simplified, as they can be controlled by setting few high-level goals, rather than having to manipulate many low-level parameters with unclear influence.
In this paper, we give a general introduction to OC, and propose a generic observer-controller architecture as a framework for designing OC systems. Then, it is shown how to use this architecture at the example of a traffic light controller. The paper concludes with a summary and a discussion of future challenges."

The goal of this paper is to present a holistic approach to
integration by using ontologies and logic. There are several
reasons for an ontology-based approach: Ontologies are able to
cover all occurring data structures, for ontologies can be seen as
nowadays most advanced knowledge representation model. They are
able to cover complexity, for the combination with deductive logic
extends the mapping and business logic capabilities. As the model
is separated from the data storage, we get a higher degree of
abstraction, whereby the semantics of the whole system is
increased. Ontologies are extendible and highly reusable and
deliver the user a better access to his relevant content.
In this paper we describe how current capabilities of knowledge
representation, mapping of structures and description of the
business logic are extended. In an elaborated case study of a
specific R&amp;D process in the automobile industry we demonstrate
that the complex integration process can be realized much easier,

That is, the paper introduces a formal semantics for KARL. Because KARL allows the representation of static and dynamic (i.e., procedural) knowledge, its semantics must integrate both types of knowledge. First, an object-oriented logic L-KARL was developed which can be used to specify static knowledge. Second, dynamic logic was used to develop P-KARL for specifying knowledge about dynamics. Third, both languages had to be combined to represent a complete model of expertise.

web applications, where database schemas are first &amp;#8220;lifted&amp;#8221; to the ontology level
and then mapped to the ontologies of the applications, and (b) the usage of different
heterogeneous ontologies within semantic web applications (e.g. by reusing different
domain ontologies).
(II) Ontology evolution deals with the fact that in reality ontologies are typically not
static entities but they rather evolve over time. This holds also for ontologies which participate
in mappings to other ontologies. Therefore one can further distinguish between
(a) evolving ontology mappings, (b) mapping different versions of multiple evolving
ontology, and (c) mapping between versions of one ontology.
To handle the increasing number of individual ontologies, but also for being able to
create mappings on the fly, it becomes necessary to develop automatic approaches. In
this paper, we determine mappings based on the similarity of the features of individual
ontological entities. We show that mappings can be derived automatically and on the
fly by encoding similarities into logical axioms and processing them with an inference
engine. The advantages of this approach are obvious. Firstly, the axioms can easily be
reused for mappings of arbitrary ontologies, no additional modeling effort is required.
Secondly, the inference engine is the only mandatory technological infrastructure which

Digital Libraries, which makes use of two different sources for change detection

we first illustrate how to deal with usage-driven changes, that is changes
derived from the actual usage of ontologies. Second, we describe the generation
of data-driven ontology changes based on the constant flow of documents coming
into Digital Libraries. The proposed framework for ontology ontology evolution, which is
currently applied and evaluated in case studies, significantly reduces the costs
of ontology updates and improves the quality of the ontology with respect to the

In this article, we show how this can be achieved by high-level Petri nets&#8212;namely, the so-called NR/T-nets (Nested-Relation/Transition Nets). In NR/T-nets, the structural part is modeled by nested relations, and the behavioral part is modeled by a novel Petri net formalism. Each place of a net represents a nested relation scheme, and the marking of each place is given as a nested relation of the respective type. Insert and delete operations in a nested relational database (NF2-database) are expressed by transitions in a net. These operations may operate not only on whole tuples of a given relation, but also on &#8220;subtuples&#8221; of existing tuples. The arcs of a net are inscribed with so-called Filter Tables, which allow (together with an optional logical expression as transition inscription) conditions to be formulated on the specified (sub-) tuples. The occurrence rule for NR/T-net transitions is defined by the operations union, intersection, and &#8220;negative&#8221; in lattices of nested relations. The structure of an NR/T-net, together with the occurrence rule, defines classes of possible information system procedures, i.e., sequences of (possibly concurrent) operations in an information system."

In fact, we examine a variant of the psm propose-and-revise. The variant was developed as a solution to the current Sisyphus task (VT-task). We decompose the entire method into its individual subtasks and examine each subtask for its underlying assumptions concerning the available domain knowledge. By doing this, we determine assumptions and limitations of the entire method. In addition, we examine how different control flows between these subtasks can influence the efficiency and effectiveness of the method. Again, we show how these differences are related to the assumptions of the method. Making these assumptions explicit defines interesting goals for validation and verification efforts. First, we show that under some circumstances two psm's behave equally well or that one is more suitable than another. Second, we have to prove for a given domain knowledge whether it fulfils the assumptions of a selected problem-solving method. We believe that such studies are necessary to allow the reuse of psm's and, conversely, that the reuse of psm's justifies the effort of such activities"

The gap between a user&#8217;s need and his query is quantified by measuring several types of query ambiguities, that are used for ranking of the refinements.

Whereas some effort already was invested in reusing work from related research areas towards the end of Ontology Evaluation, often the basic premises of the web-like environment are forgotten or disregarded.

Ontologies now play an important role for many knowledge-intensive applications for which they provide a source of formally defined terms. They aim at capturing domain knowledge in a generic way and provide a commonly agreed understanding of a domain, which may be reused, shared, and operationalized across applications and groups. Numerous ontologies are already available and the number is growing rapidly. Still a well understood definition or even intuition about qualities that apply to ontologies is lacking. The large visibility of the Semantic Web already attracts industrial partners. Ontology-based tools depend more and more on the explicit knowledge captured in ontologies. A well-understood notion of Ontology Evaluation might lead to a consistent level of quality and thus acceptance by industry. For the future this might lead to certification efforts for such ontologies.

The aim of this workshop is to ground Ontology Evaluation firmly on the needs of the Semantic Web, especially regarding its web-like characteristics like high interconnectivity, constant change and incompleteness. We will focus on the Semantic Web languages as standardized or proposed by the W3C: RDF(S), OWL and the rule language. We want to encourage and stimulate discussion about the current state of the art in Ontology Evaluation and its future direction. Currently, ontologies and the Semantic Web attract researchers from all around the world and from various disciplines, sometimes forgetful of the new needs and conditions arising from the Semantic Web&amp;#8217;s requirements."
http://www.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/Publikationen/viewPublikationOWL/id103instance,http://swrc.ontoware.org/ontology#abstract,Population based ACO algorithms for dynamic optimization problems are studied in this paper. In the population based approach a set of solutions is transferred from one iteration of the algorithm to the next instead of transferring pheromone information as in most ACO algorithms. The set of solutions is then used to compute the pheromone information for the ants of the next iteration. The population based approach can be used to solve dynamic optimization problems when a good solution of the old instance can be modified after a change of the problem instance so that it represents a reasonable solution for the new problem instance. This is tested experimentally for a dynamic TSP and dynamic QAP problem. Moreover the behavior of different strategies for updating the population of solutions are compared.

However, a problem-solving method cannot directly be applied because of the existence of a gap between, on the one hand, a problem-solving method and the domain knowledge it uses, and, on the other hand, a problem-solving method and the goal that it is supposed to achieve. In this paper, we distinguish two types of assumptions based on an architecture of problem-solving methods, that are able to bridge the gap: one type of assumption is used to strengthen a problem-solving method, and the other to weaken the goal to be achieved. We also show how the effect of one assumption type can be substituted by the effect of the other type, and refer to this as ""the law of conservation of assumptions""."

http://www.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/Publikationen/viewPublikationOWL/id595instance,http://swrc.ontoware.org/ontology#abstract,"In recent years two main technologies for knowledge sharing and reuse have emerged: ontologies and problem solving methods (PSMs). Ontologies specify reusable conceptualizations which can be shared by multiple reasoning components communicating during a problem solving process. PSMs describe in a domain-independent way the generic reasoning steps and knowledge types needed to perform a task. Typically PSMs are specified in a task-specific fashion, using modelling frameworks which describe their control and inference structures as well as their knowledge requirements and competence. In this paper we discuss a novel approach to PSM specification, which is based on the use of formal ontologies. In particular our specifications abstract from control, data flow and other dynamic aspects of PSMs to focus on the logical theory associated with a PSM (method ontology). This approach concentrates on the competence and knowledge requirements of a PSM, rather than internal control details, thus enabling black-box-style reuse. In the paper we also look at the nature of PSM specifications and we show that these can be characterised in a task-independent style as generic search strategies. The resulting ""modelling gap"" between method-independent task specifications and task-independent method ontologies can be bridged by constructing the relevant adapter ontology, which reformulates the method ontology in task-specific terms. An important aspect of the ontology-centred approach described here is that, in contrast with other characterisations of task-independent PSMs, it does away with the simple, binary distinction between weak and strong methods. We argue that any method can be defined in either task-independent or task-dependent style and therefore such distinction is of limited utility in PSM reuse. The differences between PSMs which affect reuse concern the ontological commitments which they make with respect to domain knowledge and goal specifications."

http://www.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/Publikationen/viewPublikationOWL/id882instance,http://swrc.ontoware.org/ontology#abstract,"Semantic alignment between ontologies is a necessary precondition to establish interoperability
between agents or services using different ontologies. Thus, in recent years
different methods for automatic ontology alignment have been proposed to deal with
this challenge. Thereby, the proposed methods were constricted to one of two different
paradigms: Either, (i), proposals would include a manually predefined automatic
method for proposing alignments, which would be used in the actual alignment process. They typically consist of a number of substrategies such as finding similar
labels. Or, (ii), proposals would learn an automatic alignment method based on instance
representations, e.g. bag-of-word models of documents. Both paradigms suffer
from drawbacks. The first paradigm suffers from the problem that it is impossible,
even for an expert knowledge engineer, to predict what strategy of aligning entities
is most successful for a given pair of ontologies. This is especially the case with increasing
complexity of ontology languages or increasing amounts of domain specific
conventions. The second paradigm is often hurt by the lack of instances or instance
descriptions. Also, knowledge encoded in the intensional descriptions of concepts and
relations is only marginally exploited by this way.
Hence, there remains the need to automatically combine multiple diverse and complementary
alignment strategies of all indicators, i.e. extensional and intensional descriptions,
in order to produce comprehensive, effective and efficient semi-automatic
alignment methods. Such methods need to be flexible to cope with different strategies
for various application scenarios, e.g. by using parameters. We call them &amp;#8220;Parameterizable
Alignment Methods&amp;#8221; (PAM).We have developed a bootstrapping approach
for acquiring the parameters that drive such a PAM. We call our approach APFEL for

The approach is based on combining price models and learning objects by extending the learning objects' XML metadata on the one hand and on the representation of processes as exchanges and manipulations of XML documents on the other hand. Consideration of price models in a workflow-based learning-object management system thus allows for explicitly modeling processes for pricing such as price negotiations between learners and learning object providers or mediators.

Our work deals with the construction and reuse of knowledge base components from a knowledge engineering point of view. In order to reuse domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge experience has shown that powerful and integrated methods and tools are absolutely necessary.
Therefore we describe KARO (Knowledge Acquisition Environment with Reusable Ontologies) providing different means for retrieving and adapting concept definitions of a commonsense ontology as part of a domain model construction process. In our framework commonsense ontologies are defined as highly domain-independent knowledge bases containing conceptual definitions which formalise theories about, e.g., time, objects, space. We introduce the formal, linguistic and graphical methods, the architecture and other properties of KARO. By reusing these ontologies in a well-defined way conceptual domain models can be developed easier and made more robust.
In addition, we show how KARO and MIKE (Model-based and Incremental Knowledge Engineering Environment) are integrated in order to support the two main notions of reuse being investigated within knowledge engineering: the reuse of problem solving methods and the reuse of ontologies. Special emphasis is put on handling the interaction between problem solving methods and ontologies."

G-KARL allows to describe the static, the functional and the dynamic view to a knowledge based system (kbs) graphically. This graphical representation makes the communication between the expert and the knowledge engineer easier. The underlying conceptual model for G-KARL is derived from the KADS model of expertise. Every primitive of G-KARL may be mapped to a language primitive of the language KARL (Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Language). KARL is a formal language, so every primitive of G-KARL has a defined formal semantics. KARL is an executable language, so G-KARL is also executable which supports the validation of the model of expertise by testing and thus allows the model of expertise to be built by prototyping. G-KARL allows to visualize the execution of this model which additionally supports the validation process. While G-KARL contains well established graphical means for the different views like the OMT-notation for the static view, data flow diagrams for the functional view and program flow diagrams for the dynamic view, G-KARL also offers new graphical primitives for specifying elementary inference actions within data flow diagrams and for specifying sufficient and necessary conditions within the static view.

Currently the semantic web attracts researchers from all around the world. Numerous tools and applications of semantic web technologies are already available and the number is growing fast. However, deploying large scale ontology solutions typically involves several separate tasks and requires applying multiple tools. Therefore pragmatic issues such as interoperability are key if industry is to be encouraged to take up ontology technology rapidly. The main aim of this workshop is therefore to encourage and stimulate discussions about the evaluation of ontology-based tools. 
The large visibility of the semantic web, itâ€™s tools and applications already attracts industrial partners, e.g. in numerous projects funded by the European Commission. In particular, as tools move from academic institutions into commercial environments they have to fulfil stronger requirements and in some cases new requirements (e.g. concerning scalability and multi-user access). Different tools from different sources need to interoperate. Typically tools are not anymore standalone solutions but integrated into a framework. This framework must be open to other commercial applications and provide connectors and interfaces to industrial standards. Larger applications need also larger ontologies and therefore require substantially more performance and scalability. 
A systematic evaluation of the tools might lead to a consistent level of quality and thus acceptance by industry. For the future this might lead into certification efforts for such tools."

The project was done in co-operation with HÃ¶gdalenverket, a heat and power plant burning household refuse in the Stockholm area, Sweden. The application problems with collecting data and the application of ILP-techniques are discussed. Results of tests performed while using SPECTRE, an ILP-algorithm developed at Stockholm University, are reported. These results show that the addition of background knowledge and addition/retraction of parameters has positive effect on the performance of the ILP-techniques. After initial tests a knowledge acquisition stage was started. This resulted in knowledge about the domain that was used for evaluating the results of learning using SPECTRE. This prevented several mistakes by interpreting data and evaluating performance. This knowledge was partly used as background knowledge for the learning algorithm. Noise handling was applied and increased the efficiency of the SPECTRE-algorithm. The paper lists the results of tests performed on data from the refuse-burning plant.

As a reaction, in the early 90's, there has been a large activity in the knowledge engineering community to define methodologies for principled knowledge-based system development. These methodologies (e.g., CommonKADS, MIKE, VITAL, TASK) succeeded in organising the development process as a set of intermediate models of the functionality of the system to be built, to end in the final implementation. Feedback from industries that use these methodologies in practice reveals, however, that building a high-quality implemented system remains a difficult and error-prone process. The main reason for this is that, although the structure of the development process is rather well understood, the transition process is less clear. In this paper, we outline an approach for assuring the transition of a conceptual model into a final implementation which satisfies particular quality criteria. The approach is based on identifying adequate transition paths and activities on models in order to achieve particular quality criteria. An essential part of the approach is formed by methodological guidelines and tool support such as change-management systems, reusable libraries, translators, decision support tools, and support for validation and verification."

The proposed system consists of three main IT nodes: a workflow system for administration and control of information flows; Web Services enabling data transfer between computers; and a Web Server controlling all applications for communication with all users in each organization. The proposed model of the Workflow Enactment Server consists of two nodes: the Rule Based Collection, and the Workflow Engine.

Several methods have been used and are well-known qua ontological methods. However, no previous attempt to construct ontologies based on professional knowledge exists, capturing judicial practical expertise. This paper shows the preliminary ontology development for the second version of the prototype Iuriservice, a web based intelligent FAQ for judicial use, containing a repository of professional judicial knowledge. The iFAQ system will focus on such knowledge and will base on OPLK &#8212;Ontology of Professional Legal Knowledge&#8212; developed by UAB. Profesional Legal Knowledge refers to the core of professional work that contains the experience of the daily treatment of cases and is unevenly distributed within individuals as a result of their professional and personal experiences. The knowledge acquisition process has been based on an ethnographic process designed by the UAB team and the Spanish School of the Judiciary within the national SEC project, to efficiently obtain useful and representative information from questionnaire-based interviews.

However, making the underlying assumptions explicit is not an easy task. The goal of our paper is to contribute to solve this problem.

For each themed meeting the major topic of one research WP has been highlighted as theme, in January this had been ""Web Services"" and in May this had been ""Language Extensions"". Operationalization of a themed meeting consists of a series of bi-lateral meetings of the highlighted WP with all the remaining ones.

In this deliverable we present a brief overview of the research advance achieved so far which consists of summaries of the results so far achieved in each research work package (WP2.1 Scalability, WP2.2 Heterogeneity, WP2.3 Scalability, WP2.4 Web Services and WP2.5 Language Extensions) and summaries of bi-lateral meetings among different work packages."

While the availability of extensive PSM libraries and the emerging consensus on PSM specification languages indicate the maturity of the field, a number of important research issues are still open. In particular, very little progress has been achieved on foundational and methodological issues. Existing libraries of PSMs lack a clear theoretical basis and only provide weak support for the method development process, usually in the form of informal guidelines. In this paper we will address these issues by illustrating a framework which characterizes PSMs in terms of problem commitments, problem-solving paradigms and domain assumptions. This framework provides i) a theoretical foundation for situating PSM research and individual PSMs, as well as ii) an organization which allows us to characterize method development and selection as a process of navigating through a three-dimensional space (defined by the three components of our framework). Individual moves through this space are specified by means of adapters. In the paper we will illustrate these ideas in detail, with examples taken from parametric design problem solving."

The main difficulty is the wrong context in which information is found and, therefore, part of the problem lies in the process of providing metadata about information resources on the web.  In other words, only by searching for keywords, which are assigned to the content of an information resource, a machine agent cannot differ between various contexts of using these keywords, and some non-relevant resources will be retrieved as the result of the searching process.   
In this paper, we propose a method for improving the annotation of information resources â€“ by forming conditional statements about keywords used in the describing content of a resource. This kind of annotation leads to the better precision of the information retrieval process â€“ by expressing the context of searching in a more precise manner. Moreover, such more expressive form of describing content of information resources supports a more powerful knowledge sharing process enabling the discovery of new information by considering the combination of existing information resources. In that way, the system provides some answers which are not explicitly stated in the information repository.
We present a knowledge management framework, which implements such type of annotation and give a small evaluation study. The framework is supported by Semantic Web technologies, which are based on the machine-understandable description of document content, enabling in that way the automation of the knowledge sharing process."

Regular Galois connections turn out to be much more common than irregular ones, and we identify many cases in which no irregular ones can be found at all. To this end, we demonstrate that irregularity of Galois connections on sublattices can be lifted to superlattices, and observe close relationships to various notions of distributivity. This is achieved by combining methods from algebraic order theory and FCA with recent results on dual bonds. Disjunctions in formal contexts play a prominent role in the proofs and add a logical flavor to our considerations.

Here, this topic is addressed in the context of the design phase of the MIKE approach to kbs development. In MIKE, design decisions are motivated primarily by non-functional requirements. Due to the iterative nature of the design process, design decisions have to be evaluated early. In MIKE, this can be achieved by experimental prototyping, but also by quantitative measures associated to requirements. Furthermore, in order to improve transparency and traceability, the description of the design includes a record of the design decisions and their motivation in addition to a description of the artefact.

Two kinds of analyses of the usersâ€™ queries are performed: static - related to the ontological properties and dynamic - related to the usersâ€™ interaction with the system. Regarding to the first analysis we define several assessment criteria for the quality of the metadata. For the second analysis, we introduced the Log ontology as a backbone for storing and analysing information about usersâ€™ behaviours in the Portal. We extended the previous research done in the analysing Query logs by introducing query-rewriting patterns.

By robustness, we mean that small deviations from the original design, e.g., due to manufacturing tolerances, should be tolerated without a severe loss of quality. One way to achieve that goal is to evaluate each solution under a number of different scenarios, and use the average solution quality as fitness. However, this approach is often impractical, because the cost for evaluating each individual several times is unacceptable. In this paper, we present a new and efficient approach to estimating a solution's expected quality and variance. Basically, we propose to construct local approximate models of the fitness function, and then use these approximate models to estimate expected fitness and variance. Based on a variety of test function, we demonstrate empirically that our approach significantly outperforms the implicit averaging approach as well as the explicit averaging approaches using existing estimation techniques reported in the literature."

http://www.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/Publikationen/viewPublikationOWL/id1258instance,http://swrc.ontoware.org/ontology#abstract,"An ontology alignment is the expression of relations between different ontologies. In order to view alignments independently from the language expressing ontologies and from the techniques used for finding the alignments, we use a category-theoretical model in which ontologies are the objects. We introduce a categorical structure, called V-alignment, made of a pair of morphisms with a common domain having the ontologies as codomain. This structure serves to design an algebra that describes formally what are ontology merging, alignment composition, union and intersection using categorical constructions. This enables combining alignments of various provenance. Although the desirable properties of this algebra make such abstract manipulation of V-alignments very simple, it is practically not well fitted for expressing complex alignments: expressing subsumption between entities of two different ontologies demands the definition of non-standard categories of ontologies. We consider two approaches to solve this problem. The first one extends the notion of V-alignments to a more complex structure called W-alignments: a formalization of alignments relying on &quot;bridge axioms.&quot; The second one relies on an elaborate concrete category of ontologies that offers high expressive power. We show that these two extensions have different advantages that may be exploited in different contexts (viz., merging, composing, joining or meeting): the first one efficiently processes ontology merging thanks to the possible use of categorical institution theory, while the second one benefits from the simplicity of the algebra of V-alignments."

It provides an interactive theorem prover integrated into a sophisticated tool environment supporting aspects like the automatic generation of proof obligations, generation of counter examples, proof management, proof reuse etc. Such a support is essential in making verification of complex specifications feasible.

MIKE integrates semiformal and formal specification techniques together with prototyping into a coherent framework. All activities in the building process of a knowledge-based system are embedded in a cyclic process model. For the semiformal representation we use a hypermedia-based formalism which serves as a communication basis between expert and knowledge engineer during knowledge acquisition. The semiformal knowledge representation is also the basis for formalization, resulting in a formal and executable model, specified in the Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Language (KARL). Since KARL is executable the model of expertise can be developed and validated by prototyping. A smooth transition from a semiformal to a formal specification and further on to design is achieved because all the description techniques rely on the same conceptual model to describe the functional and non-functional aspects of the system. Thus, the system is thoroughly documented at different description levels, each of which focuses on a distinct aspect of the entire development effort.

Change discovery aims at generating implicit requirements
by inducing ontology changes from existing data.
We here focus on {em usage-driven} change discovery.
Usage data is a very valuable source of contextual information, based on which
the ontology can be modified in order to reflect changes in the real world,

In a precedent deliverable we have presented a framework for
usage-driven ontology evolution along with a set of methods for
change discovery. In this deliverable we evaluate this framework
by applying it to actual use cases from the BT DL case study. The
use cases include (1) usage-based pruning of a generic ontology to
obtain a personalized ontology, and (2) extending an existing
ontology with personalized extensions obtained via Ontology
Learning techniques. The evaluation results show the usefulness of
applying usage data for the task of ontology evolution."
http://www.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/Publikationen/viewPublikationOWL/id671instance,http://swrc.ontoware.org/ontology#abstract,"In the field of Knowledge Engineering, dissatisfaction with the rapid-prototyping approach has led to a number of more principled methodologies for the construction of knowledge-based systems. Instead of immediately implementing the gathered and interpreted knowledge in a given implementation formalism according to the rapid-prototyping approach, many such methodologies centre around the notion of a conceptual model: an abstract, implementation independent description of the relevant problem solving expertise. A conceptual model should describe the task which is solved by the system and the knowledge which is required by it. Although such conceptual models have often been formulated in an informal way, recent years have seen the advent of formal and operational languages to describe such conceptual models more precisely, and operationally as a means for model evaluation. In this paper, we study a number of such formal and operational languages for specifying conceptual models. In order to enable a meaningful comparison of such languages, we focus on languages which are all aimed at the same underlying conceptual model, namely that from the KADS method for building KBS. We describe eight formal languages for KADS models of expertise, and compare these languages with respect to their modelling primitives, their semantics, their implementations and their applications. Future research issues in the area of formal and operational specification languages for KBS are identified as the result of studying these languages. The paper also contains an extensive bibliography of research in this area."

Most recently, however, new methodologies have been proposed which allow one to derive uniform characterizations of different declarative semantics for logic programs with negation. In this paper, we study the relationship between two of these approaches, namely the level mapping characterizations due to [Hitzler and Wendt 2005], and the selector generated models due to [Schwarz 2004]. We will show that the latter can be captured by means of the former, thereby supporting the claim that level mappings provide a very flexible framework which is applicable to very diversely defined semantics."

In addition, the user profile is different for each website and cannot be combined with other information on the web. Using Semantic Web technologies, in particular FOAF, we can identify the person browsing to the website. In this paper, we propose an extension of the HTTP GET method to include a new parameter that points to the URL of the user&amp;#8217;s FOAF file. This simple, but powerful extension enables the web server to use information contained in the person's FOAF file to personalize the web pages returned.

http://www.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/Publikationen/viewPublikationOWL/id299instance,http://swrc.ontoware.org/ontology#abstract,An empirical evaluation of the ILP system JoJo-FOL is presented. JoJo-FOL uses an iterative method to discover rules for a single concept within the normal inductive logic programming framework. The search process starts with a very restricted hypothesis space to efficiently derive most general and correct clauses first. This strong language bias is weakened by iteratively increasing the number of variables allowed to occur in a clause such that JoJo-FOL is able to induce additional correct but more specific clauses. JoJo-FOL conducts its search through the hypothesis space in a bidirectional manner controlled by two criteria of success derived from the completeness and consistency requirements. In an empirical evaluation JoJo-FOL was tested on two ILP benchmark data sets. The results presented show that the iterative rule discovery method combined with the bidirectional search strategy leads to more general rules and a higher accuracy compared to well-known ILP systems on the tested domains.

An important factor for successful method reuse is the specification of preexisting methods and support in their task- and domain-specific refinements. The PROTÃ‰GÃ‰-II approach allows developers to select methods from a library, and to map the methods to a domain ontology. KARL is a formal and executable knowledge-specification language that provides modeling primitives for expressing problem-solving methods. In this paper, we show how the code and informal descriptions of problem-solving methods in PROTÃ‰GÃ‰-II can be supplemented with the formal method definitions in KARL. For our case study, we have chosen two methods from the PROTÃ‰GÃ‰-II framework: chronological backtracking and its task specific refinement: the board-game method. In the paper, we give insights in the refinement of general-purpose methods to task-specific (i.e., strong) problem-solving methods. We show further, how a task-specific method can be adapted to a given domain and application. In both cases this is achieved by introducing ontological commitments over the terminological structure of the entities used to describe the states of the reasoning process of a method."

usage of the mapping rules and of web services for semantic

order to create metadata, the framework combines the presention
layer with the data description layer --- in contrast to
``conventional'' annotation, which remains at the presentation
layer. Therefore, we refer to the framework by deep
annotation
We consider deep annotation as particularly valid because, (i), web pages generated from databases outnumber static
web pages, (ii), annotation of web pages may be a very
intuitive way to create semantic data from a database and, (iii), data from databases should not be materialized as
RDF files, they should remain where they can be handled most

In this paper, we use such an application in database marketing to demonstrate how methods and procedures of CKDD can be applied in Data Analysis. In particular, we show the interplay and integration of data mining and data analysis techniques based on ForÂ­ mal Concept Analysis.

OWL is a knowledge representation language for the definition of ontologies, standardised by the W3C.

Being created as part of the notoriously known Semantic Web language stack, its dynamics and openness lends naturally to the ever evolving Python language.

which allows to express (partially) hierarchically ordered evolving knowledge
bases through (partially) ordered multi sets of logic programs and
allowing to solve contradictions among rules in different programs by allowing
rules in more important programs to reject rules in less important
ones. This class of programs extends the class of dynamic logic program
that provides meaning and semantics to sequences of logic programs. Recently
a semantics named refined stable model semantics has fixed some
counterintuitive behaviour of previously existing semantics for dynamic
logic programs. However, it is not possible to directly extend the definitions

case and hence more sophisticated principles and techniques are in order.
In this paper we face the problem of defining a proper semantics

increased use of combined heat and power plants at a local level

It extends our previous work in the ontology evolution by taking into account the usage of the ontology in the knowledge management system. The approach is mainly based on the analysis of the usersâ€™ behaviour in two phases of a knowledge management cycle: (i) in providing knowledge by analysing the quality of annotations and (ii) in searching for knowledge by analysing usersâ€™ queries and the responses from the knowledge repository. This analysis results in the recommendations for changes in the underlying ontology, the annotations and/or the knowledge repository in order to make the whole system more efficient. We present two short case studies."

We are presenting two examples: looking up object names in WordNet and using Ontobroker as an inference engine on ECCMA ontologies.  This article shows how different 2-dimensional visualization techniques such as DAMLVisio or simple Visio shapes can be applied to semantic web models in order to address a broad range of users with very different expectations on the notation.

Efficient inter-organizational business processes in the field of e-commerce require the integration of electronic document interchange and inter-organizational process management. We propose to support inter-organizational business processes by so-called XML nets, a new variant of high-level Petri nets. XML nets are a formal, graphical modeling language that allows to model both the flow of XML documents and the control flow of the underlying business process. XML nets are based on GXSL, a novel graphical XML schema definition language, and its related graphical XML document manipulation language XManiLa. They can be directly executed by a respective workflow engine. Advantage of the formal foundation of XML nets can be taken, e.g., when analyzing a (global) inter-organizational workflow model. XML nets support the identification of relevant process fragments and their allocation to the appropriate organizational units. Thus XML nets help to derive an improved, process-oriented organizational structure."

The systems are typically built on top of a database that contains profiles of employees and applicants. Thus, the skills may be retrieved through database queries. However, these approaches incur two major problems, viz. the finding of approximate matches and the maintenance of skill data. In this paper we describe two systems that leverage corporate skill knowledge by offering advanced means for both. We present ProPer that uses means from decision theory to allow for compensate skill matching. Then, we describe OntoProPer that combines these methods with intelligent means for inferencing of skill data. For the latter an ontology provides background knowledge, i.e. conceptual structures and rules, which supplement the skill database with ground and inferred facts from secondary information, such as project documents. These supplement facts re-duce maintenance efforts since much secondary information is gathered in the organizational memory through common working tasks. Keywords: skill management, human resource management, ontologies, intranet application."

Design/methodology/approach - A structured approach in form of a reference model for the re-engineering of existing educational material is presented. In this context, concepts already established in the area of aspect-oriented programming are applied to deal with crosscutting concerns in e-learning material. Finally, a software product line approach is proposed for the creation of new courseware using re-engineered components. Findings - It turns out that some aspects of the methodology developed for aspect-oriented programming can also be used to restructure the existing e-learning material in such a way that maintenance is eased and redundancy is significantly reduced. In addition, software product lines for e-learning material provide a global framework for coordinating the re-engineering and reuse of components. Practical implications - The advantage of the proposed approach is that existing e-learning standards and systems do not have to be modified or adapted. Originality/value - Usually, courseware evolves during a longer period of time and its development does not start every time from zero. There is a high incentive for re-engineering of existing courseware, since it constitutes in many cases the competitive advantage of companies or universities. However, up to now, little attention is paid to the maintenance and the efficient update of e-learning material which is already there."

This compilation may be used as a basis for the modelling and implementation of quality information systems within the scope of e-learning. Firstly weâ€™ll have a look on the state of the art related to this work. Then weâ€™ll present different types of quality-relevant data, which should be the principal constituents every quality information system for e-learning applications should have. Afterwards weâ€™ll close with a conclusion and an outlook."
